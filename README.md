# wnoz-schedule

Little script which downloads and parses XLS schedule.

Ultimately used in CI with cron as a trigger.

[Example](.github/workflows/regenerate-files.yml)

**:warning: Note: I did my best, but I can't guarantee that this script works 100% of the time. If you stumble across some bug, please open an issue or submit a PR**
